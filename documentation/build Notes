# Blurb-notes-to-self

-This project uses motoko programming language, and was created using "dfx new dbank",
Old version delete due no longer working so deleted using "rm -rf foldername":
dfx outdated so did not work.
updated dfx by using "dfxvm update" now using version dfx 0.24.3
All work will be done in main.mo found in src folder
Terminal one starts with "dfx start" and runs the internet computer
Terminal "dfx deploy" run the application now both working
motoko uses
"let"
(similar as constant in js)
"var"
(similar as value that can be changed)
by adding a modifyer word call "public" to the func it can be call from outside the private function.

## Introduced-candid-IU-interface

 which is an easy way to interact with our canistars instead of using dfx command line
creation of candid ui by using "dfx canister id __Candid_UI" in terminal two
to get address code for candid in browser it returned "r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai"
which was then pasted into browser with this written before it.
"<http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=>" which created page then asked for second id which was created by using "dfx canister id dbank" returned "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai" and added it to canister input field and pressed go to get "<http://127.0.0.1:8000/?><canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai">
the https page can be located with control click form the second terminal once deployed
the browser page return gui page to reflect value changing with new calculations
