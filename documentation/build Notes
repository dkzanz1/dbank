# Blurb-notes-to-self
Created due to the fact that work on more than project at any one time and it helps me remember project progress
-This project uses motoko programming language,it was created using "dfx new dbank",
Old version delete due no longer working so deleted using "rm -rf foldername":
dfx outdated so did not work.
updated dfx by using "dfxvm update" now using version dfx 0.24.3
All work will be done in main.mo found in src folder.
Terminal one starts with "dfx start" and runs the internet computer
Terminal two "dfx deploy" run the application now both working
I prefer to use terminal three to run "npm start" which starts the browser coded page to run (which come later in video porgress)
motoko uses
"let"
(similar as constant in js)
"var"
(similar as value that can be changed)
by adding a modifyer word call "public" to the func it can be call from outside the private function.

## Introduced-usage-candid-IU-interface

 Which is an easy way to interact with our canistars instead of using dfx command line
creation of candid ui by using "dfx canister id __Candid_UI" in terminal two
to get address code for candid in browser it returned "r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai"
which was then pasted into browser with this written before it.
"<http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=>" which created page then asked for second id which was created by using "dfx canister id dbank" returned "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai" and added it to canister input field and pressed go to get "<http://127.0.0.1:8000/?><canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai">
the https page can be located with control click form the second terminal once deployed
the browser page return gui page to reflect value changing with new calculations

### Introduction-of-javascript

code created via javascript  to get the user interface to run calculation
index.js holds the code.
to start gui dfx start(1st terminal)dfx deploy (2nd terminal)npm start(3rd terminal)localhost:8080
problem{-}
an issue with the version of node?,
I was using, so downgraded to latest most stable version from 23.6.0 to 22.13.0 jodi to see if helps a bit, it was the dependency that needed changing and re-installing
taken from Q&a in udemy
7 months ago
Because Angela is using in the video some older version, newer versions of the dependencies will not work
Here is the solution:
Rollback to older version
1.uninstall current dep
npm uninstall @dfinity/agent @dfinity/candid @dfinity/principal webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server

2.reainstall with working versions:
npm i @dfinity/agent@0.15.2 @dfinity/candid@0.15.2 @dfinity/principal@0.15.2 webpack@5.63.0 webpack-cli@5.0.0
webpack-dev-server@4.4.0 end
now working I beileve that loading to early vervion of dfinity created a new issue with Nan value in placeholder on form for value so upgrade infinity to 0.19.0 as suggested in q&a SEEMS TO WORK
