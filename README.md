# dbank

Welcome to your new dbank project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with dbank, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/developers-guide/sdk-guide.html)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/motoko.html)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/language-guide/language-manual.html)
- [JavaScript API Reference](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dbank/
dfx help
dfx config --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

Additionally, if you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 8000.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`NODE_ENV` to `production` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.NODE_ENV` in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

### Blub notes to self

This project uses motoko programming language, and was created using "dfx new dbank",
Old version delete due no longer working so deleted using "rm -rf foldername":
dfx outdated so did not work.
updated dfx by using "dfxvm update" now using version dfx 0.24.3
All work will be done in main.mo found in src folder
Terminal one starts with "dfx start" and runs the internet computer
Terminal "dfx deploy" run the application now both working
motoko uses
"let"
(similar a constant in js)
"var"
(similar a value that can be changed)
by adding a modifyer word call "public" to the func it can be call from outside the private function
introduced candid IU interface which is an easy way to interact with our canistars instead og using dfx command line
creation of candid ui by using "dfx canister id __Candid_UI" in terminal two
to get address code for candid in browser it returned "r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai"
which was then pasted into browser with this before it 
"http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=" which created page then asked for second id which was created by using "dfx canister id dbank" returned "rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai" and added it to canestaer input field and pressed go to get "http://127.0.0.1:8000/?canisterId=r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai&id=rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai"
